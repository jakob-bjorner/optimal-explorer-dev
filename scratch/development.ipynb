      "- '8' can only be in Position 1 or Position 2 as confirmed by Evidence B.\n",

      "- The guess was 235.\n",
      "- From this:\n",
      "  - The digit '2' is NOT in the combination.\n",
      "  - The digit '3' is NOT in the combination.\n",
      "  - The digit '5' IS in the combination and IS in the correct position (Position 3).\n",

      "  - The digit '1' IS in the combination and IS in the correct position (Position 2).\n",
      "  - The digit '8' IS in the combination but IS NOT in the correct position (Position 3).\n",

      "Now, we know:\n",
      "- Position 2 is occupied by the digit '1'.\n",
      "- The digit '5' is in Position 3, but it's not '8', so the digit '8' is not '5'.\n",
      "- We know '5' and '8' are the two digits left that are not yet placed.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Synthesizing Information:\n",
      "From Evidence B, we conclude:\n",
      "- Position 2: '1' (Confirmed)\n",
      "- Position 3: '5' (Incorrect position, confirmed by E1)\n",
      "- Hence, the digits '8' and '5' are still candidates for position 1, and we've now identified:\n",
      "  - Position 1: Could be '8' or '5'\n",
      "  - Position 2: '1'\n",
      "  - Position 3: '5' (Incorrect but confirmed by E1)\n",
      "\n",
      "Since we already know '5' is in the correct position (by E1), and it is in Position 3 as confirmed by E2:\n",
      "- Position 1: Not '5' -> It could be '8'\n",
      "- Position 3: '5'\n",
      "- Position 2: '1'\n",

      "   - '3' in Position 1 is **not** in the combination (confirms '3' in the combination from Evidence A).\n",
      "   - '1' in Position 2 is **in** the combination and is **in the correct position** (Position 2).\n",

      "3. **From this, we can conclude:**\n",
      "   - The number **includes a 1** in Position 2.\n",

      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "1. We know **Position 3** includes a **5**, and the number **does not include a 2** or a 3.\n",
      "2. Position 2 includes a **1**.\n",

      "- Ensuring that the digits can fit based on the positions:\n",
      "    - Since **Position 3** is **5**, we exclude 2 and 3, and we need a digit (1, 8, or others) that fits in Position 2.\n",
